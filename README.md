# fcm-node

A quickstart implementation to illustrate the use of firebase admin SDK in node js

Clone the repo and run 

``` npm
npm install
```
The app uses express js and the firebase admin SDK provided by Google. This SDK is also available in other languages like Java, python etc. but sending a firebase push message is only supported for the node sdk.
